# Huffman Tree Encoder
## An elegant way to compress text files

### Install:
Simply clone the repository and build the executable by running `make` in its directory within a terminal.

### Usage:
`./Compress [-c] [txt_name] [bin_output]`  Compresses text file to binary file

`./Compress [-d] [bin_name] [txt_output]`  Decompresses binary file to text file

### About
Building a huffman tree for encoding and decoding files in C was a great way to practice important coding practices such as descriptive variable names and organization of functions.  The data structures needed to produce and utilize this unique binary tree was fun to write as well.  Feel free to clone this to use as an educational sample.

I have included the text file of *War and Peace* as a test file.
